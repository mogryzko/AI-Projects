  A python program that plays othello against a human or itself. Impliments minimax and alpha-beta pruning to select its next move.
  
spam_filter.py:
  A naive bayes classifier that learns from a training dataset and classifies messages as either spam or not spam.
  
picture_classifier.py:
  An experiment with Keras and Tensorflow systems to build a neural network that classifies images as containing certain objects. Warning: because of the time and processing power required, it is best to run this on a jupyter notebook virtual environment.
